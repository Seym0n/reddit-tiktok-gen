      "title": "AITA for saying not everything is about your Kid?",
      "content": "I was having a small birthday party for my son. We decided on his favorite pizza place. Both my SIL and Daughter are vegetarian and I asked them both what kind of pizza they wanted and they both chose garden pizza with all veggies. We also had pepperoni and a meat lovers, cheesy garlic bread, wings and an Italian salad. Lots of food for dinner plus the cake and ice cream later.\n\nMy bother comes with his new girlfriend and her son. I have never met this boy. I was an extremely busy mom with my 3 kids and 4 other cousins. The girlfriend ask where the cheese pizza is and I told her we don’t have cheese. She started in on my brother about how could you not tell your family my child only likes cheese pizza and says something about it’s because of his autism. I said we have cheesy garlic bread but the boy didn’t like that either. Then I suggested he could have extra large piece of cake. It was white with sprinkles. Her kid only liked chocolate cake.\n\nAround this time my son and his other cousins started arguing about Fortnite and the new update and my son decided he wanted the airbender battle pass and I’m side tracked with that and logging the cousin into my daughter’s switch.\n\nThe girlfriend asked me to order a cheese pizza for her son so he could have something to eat. I snapped back with “not everything is about your kid”\n\nI was then distracted by my daughter yelling at her cousin because she didn’t want him playing her switch with gross chicken grease hands. I went to defuse that.\n\nAfterwards when it came to cake and ice cream time I noticed my brother, his girlfriend and her son left.\n\nI get a long text message from my brother about how I could bully a child and his mother and what an awful example I’m setting for my kids. I do not feel like I was out of line and she was a rude guest and now my brother and I aren’t talking."

      "title": "AITA for implying to mom I won't help her and my siblings out after I turn 18?",
      "content": "My mom is a single mom and we struggle. I'm (17M) the oldest and I have four younger siblings (14F, 12F, 9M and 8F). We have two different dads. Me and my 14 and 12 year old sisters share a dad and he walked out on us while mom was pregnant with my 12 year old sister. A year later she found another guy and he was bad news but my mom was so desperate for a guy and overlooked a lot of red flags. She had two kids with him and then he stole from my mom and left without ever looking back and left us in a really tight position. After that my mom would lean on me a lot and she asked me to step up and be there for my siblings and help more around the house and I did it because I wanted to help my mom. I hoped it would mean she wouldn't rush into another relationship with another dude who was bad news.\n\nIt was tough though. Like having to help with homework and feeding my siblings and being responsible for most of the cleaning was a lot. My mom still did stuff it was just she had to work and couldn't be there all the time. But after a year or so of that she started to take her frustrations out on me verbally. She'd complain about calls from my school (I struggle in school even still). Or if I forgot to do something. She'd tell me I couldn't let her down and I needed to act more like an adult and do better. When I was 14 she asked me if I could start making money and I did. I helped around the neighborhood for some extra money and I got a part time job a year later and gave mom the money from that. But it was like she'd take it all out on me more. If I got home late from work or school she'd tell me to cut it out and I needed to be more responsible. If a bill wasn't paid on time she'd tell me to be less useless or be more useful. If I couldn't do something she'd ask me what good was I doing. She'd tell me I wasn't a kid anymore and needed to stop expecting the life of one out of nowhere sometimes. Eventually I got so tired of it and it became so constant that I started saving money so I can get away ASAP. Mom doesn't know about it and I still give her the rest of what I make, because it's really the only way to save without her knowing.\n\nMy mom expects me to stay here and help for the next several years until my siblings are all older. I'll be out of the house as soon as I turn 18 and I won't consider staying for anyone, not even my siblings. Mom has been extra nasty lately to me and she was saying I should start looking for a full time job now so I can be a full second income. I was like \"bold of you to assume I'll be getting a full time job to help out more\" and mom was then even more pissed and she told me I fucking need to get over myself and accept it. She told me I was such a dick for implying I could abandon my siblings like that. She was so loud my siblings heard and they were upset at me too."

      "title": "AITA for canceling a date because the guy wouldn’t give me 2 dollars?",
      "content": "For context. I 30F went out with this guy 28M. It was supposed to be just a quick coffee but we really hit it off and ended up spending hours together. From about 2PM to 2AM. We’re having an amazing time we even make plans to meet up the next day and go to the market.\n\nTo be clear we went dutch on everything at this point and I was completely fine with that. We had coffee, dinner, drinks and then went dancing.\n\nWhen we were done with dancing, we were walking around and there was this street food stall with this item I’ve been dying to try. Unfortunately they took cash only. It was about 2 dollars, I know he had cashed so I asked if I could Venmo him or something. He claimed not to have venmo or anything. I said I’d give it to him tomorrow when we met up, he laughed and said what if you change your mind. It was a bit awkward but I just laughed it off and we went about or time. Tbh that soured the experience for me and I quickly was ready to go.\n\nI told him I was getting a cab back to my place and he said he’d ride back with me and walk home because he lived about a 10 minute walk. This added to my annoyance as I’m thinking I couldn’t borrow 2 dollars but you can hop my 15 dollar cab.\n\nThe cab ride was pretty awkward as I was annoyed, we hugged and said bye.\n\nI ended up texting him in the morning saying I didn’t think it would work and cancelling the second date. He was insistent on knowing the reason as we had hit it off. I was honest and told him that the fact he wouldn’t borrow me 2 dollars just kinda threw me off. He called me an AH and gold digger.\n\nI told my sister and she said he wasn’t obligated to do that for me. Now I feel like maybe I over reacted as we did really hit it off and feel a bit bad but at the same time I felt like the situation was so petty on his part.\n\nSo AITA?"

      "title": "AITA For Refusing To Babysit For My Aunt Until She Pays For My Phone That Her Kids broke?",
      "content": "My (F15) aunt and cousins (both M6) are visiting from Boston. They are on school break right now, and I'm in school, and the teacher's chill.\n\nThey are both kind of, uh, rough, and since my mom and her sister seem to have a LOT of catching up to do, they are out basically everyday. That leaves me and my brother (M14) and my other sister (F12) to babysit, and they are basically no help.\n\nOn Saturday, I wanted to actually make them baked mac and cheese, and after putting the butter on the pan, I went to go get the flour, and I guess they thought it would be funny if they decided to put my phone on the stove, because they moved the pan, and put my phone on the stove. I'd say it was there for at least 45 seconds before I noticed it was actually on the stove (We had so much flour, I couldn't find the already-opened bag) and I took it off, but there was a burning smell, as well as the screen not really working. My dad sometimes will help me with them, but he was at the gym when this all happened. I ended up making them something else.\n\nWhen my mom and aunt got back home at around, I immediately showed them my phone, and my mom was mad, but kind of became less mad when she found out it was my cousins. My Aunt basically said \"Oh well,\" and tended to her kids. So I told her not to expect crap from me until my phone is fixed. At the time we didn't get a deductible ($175) and my Aunt immediately jumped to the \"I can't afford it.\" Even though she didn't even know the cost. My mom is mad at me for being rude, my sister is mad at me for being \"Rude,\" and making her miss out on quality time with her sister. She just mumbles and grumbles every time I walk by her."
