            "title": "AITA for ignoring my husband during our flight when he expressed anxiety over flying?",
            "content": "I [33F] recently married my husband [30M] and we took a 3 hour flight to Mexico for our honeymoon.\n\nI fly a lot for my job, so I have racked up a lot of miles. My husband isn’t a big fan of flying, though he has gotten better and tends to just hold my hand and close his eyes during take off and landing (mostly okay when in the air).\n\nWhen I booked our flights I requested to use my points if an upgrade to business class became available, but made it clear I only wanted this upgrade if two seats became available and then basically forgot about it.\n\nThen comes the day of our flight. I was so excited for this trip, I checked us in online, all is going well, and then when we go to board the person scanning out boarding passes stops us. She says it seems that my husband was upgraded to business class, but ONLY him and asks if that is okay. I immediately say no, we are on our honeymoon and would like to stay together. But then my husband jumps in and says, “No it’s fine, I’ll go to business class!” I look at him in complete shock and he tells me that I fly all the time and have been in business class before, but he hasn’t. So he deserves a chance to experience it.\n\nI see we are holding up the line, so I feel like I just need to agree and get on the plane. To say I am pissed off is an understatement. He is all smiles, taking his seat and I go back to my seat where they sit me next to an old woman with a baby on her lap where my husband should be sitting.\n\nWithin maybe 5-10 minutes of sitting there, trying to hold back tears because my husband left me alone on our flight during our honeymoon (and uses MY points for his upgrade no less), he starts to text me saying he feels anxiety over flying. I ignore the texts and stop looking at my phone.\n\nWithin maybe an hour after we are in the air, he comes to the back of the plane to find me, offers me half of his business class breakfast and asks me why I was ignoring him - that he was scared and needed me to tell him it’d be okay since I am such an experienced flyer. I told him maybe he should have thought about that before leaving me alone before our honeymoon even really began. He gets angry, tells me that this may be the only time he gets to fly business class and he was giving me half his breakfast to make up for it so I could at least be supportive of his genuine fear. I roll my eyes, sarcastically say “thanks” and he goes back up to his seat.\n\nWhen we landed I tried to just move on and forget about it so that we could just enjoy our honeymoon, but he guilt tripped me about not comforting him via text before take off and now I am wondering if I am being unreasonable and should have just let him enjoy his time in business class and ensure him it’d be okay. So AITA?"

            "title": "AITA for not offering to pay after my niece accidentally ruined my sister’s wedding dress at my barbecue?",
            "content": "So, last weekend I threw a big barbecue to celebrate my promotion. It was a joyous occasion with friends and family, and everyone was in high spirits. My sister “Anna” brought along her 6-year-old daughter, “Sophie.”\n\nA bit of background: Anna is getting married next month and had recently picked up her dream wedding dress, which she’d saved up for months to afford. It’s a gorgeous, custom-made piece. During the barbecue, Anna asked if she could store the dress at my house to avoid it getting wrinkled in the car before showing it to our aunt the next day. I agreed and put it in my spare room.\n\nThe party was buzzing, kids running around, adults chatting. Sophie, who’s been in a princess phase, knew her mom had a “princess dress” and wanted to see it. Somehow, Sophie sneaked into the room where the dress was stored. She tried to pull it down to look at it, and in the process, the dress tore significantly on a piece of furniture.\n\nAnna was heartbroken when she saw the damage and looked at me like I should have done something to prevent it. I feel terrible about what happened, but I also feel like it was an accident caused by a child’s curiosity and not my direct responsibility. She hasn’t asked outright for me to pay for repairs, but there’s an unspoken expectation.\n\nAITA for thinking I shouldn’t offer to pay for the repair? Shouldn’t the responsibility lie with supervising Sophie more closely, or am I just trying to absolve myself of guilt here?"

            "title": "AITA for getting upset when a \"family day\" was entirely centered around my sister?",
            "content": "Im(16f) on my phone so bad formatting and english isnt my first language, please excuse that <3. Around last week, my parents asked me if I wanted to go on a \"family trip\" to the mall with my parents and sister(10f). For context, it was spring break and they had asked me what I wanted to do- to which I had said a trip to the Cafe in the mall would be nice, and they agreed.\n\nI assumed that was why we were going. I agreed and went with them. I was most definitely wrong about what we were doing, and spent most of my day just following my sister around as she went to get new clothes ect. She stopped for food at some point (parents paid for it, if that's relevant) and I asked if I could get some food too. They said no, and I suggested I could pay for it myself- they said no again, and moved onto the next thing once she got her food.\n\nThey basically wouldn't let me get anything to drink either, even if I paid for it myself, so it was a very long 4 and a half hours of my day. When we got home, they asked me if I had fun and I replied that \"I wouldn't have come if I knew I was just going to be following my sister around all day.\", to which they got mad at me, saying that it was an effort to spend more time with my family. I'm not really sure if I should've said that, as my sister heard and got upset about it, so I'd really appreciate peoples opinion on whether or not I'm in the wrong for saying what I did. Thank you :)"

            "title": "AITA for telling my wife that she should have included my daughter in her \"mother/daughter\" trip?",
            "content": "I (44m) have two children (18m, 16f.) My ex-wife abandonded the family when my daughter was still a baby.\n\nI recently married a woman (42f) with three kids (17f, 14f, 13m.) Their father is still involved in their lives. All of our kids are still in high school, though my son is set to graduate soon. They recently had their spring break.\n\nDuring spring break my wife took her two girls to a major city near us for a \"Mommy/daughter day.\" They ate, went to a spa, etc.\n\nBefore they went I suggested to her that she should include my daughter, but she said \"no\" as this was a yearly tradition with just her girls.\n\nWhile she was gone I took my kids and her son out for bowling and mini golf. After her trip with her girls was over, the next day, she took her son out for a \"Mother/son day\" where she took him out to see whatever movie he wanted.\n\nShe and I have been arguing ever since about how she excluded my daughter from her \"Mommy/daughter\" day. I think it was cruel. My daughter grew up without a mother and I know it would have meant a lot to her to be included. But my wife says that she was just carrying on old traditions; of spending time with just her girls and then spending time with just her son, and that she'd be happy to start a new tradition with my daughter, but that it needed to be a different thing. She also said \"I didn't bring your son along with my mother/son time with my son. Why aren't you making an issue out of that?\" I told her that it was different; that my daughter really needed girl time and that excluding her was hurtful.\n\nI still think she should have invited my daughter along; that she should have been made a new part of the \"tradition.\" AITA?"

            "title": "AITA for not taking the day off to watch my step kid?",
            "content": "On mobile, using throwaway. My spouse “Stu” shares custody of his 10 yo “Bob” with his ex and we have him every weekend and split up school breaks. Usually during school breaks I watch him bc I work from home most of the time. I do have to work in person sometimes though. Stu’s ex often just announces that we’re going to have the kid during the week if she has something going on and while this annoys my partner he always accepts it and I think this is reasonable cuz it’s his kid too- would be nice if ex communicated more in advance. Ex moved 45 mins away and Bob’s school is by her, so anytime he is here during a non break school week, he just doesn’t go to school bc Stu and his ex think it’s too much time in the car. Okay, that’s their decision. (It’s not very frequent- maybe once a month or every other).\n\nThat brings us to my question. Last week ex told Stu Bob would be staying with us Monday, Stu told me, I said “I’ll be working “ and that was the end of it until yesterday when I mentioned in the course of conversation that I had to do an in person meeting Monday. Stu immediately said “you didn’t mention that before! When did you find that out? Why does it have to be in person? Why can’t you do it Friday ?” I was taken aback and said “you remember I’m not off Monday right ?” He said yes but thought I’d be working from home.\n\nApparently he was planning on doing a bit of work himself and just assumed I’d be here. I do usually tell him when I’m going to the office but generally the day of and just so he knows, not bc I’m coordinating with him. I never said I could watch Bob, I never said I was working from home all day, and I don’t know why Bob can’t just go to school if all of the adults have to work or be somewhere. So am I the asshole ? Stu feels I would respond differently if it were my bio kid (I would, I would take him to school!), thereby making me an AH."
